# 🦀 Area Calculator (Rust CLI)

A **Command Line Interface (CLI)** application written in **Rust** that calculates the area of common geometric shapes based on user input.

This project focuses on:

* Clean Rust syntax
* Modular functions
* Safe input handling
* Practical CLI program structure

---

## 📐 Supported Shapes

The calculator supports **5 main shapes**:

1. Rectangle
2. Square
3. Circle
4. Triangle
5. Trapezium

---

## 🚀 How It Works

* The user selects a shape from a menu.
* The program asks for the required dimensions.
* The area is calculated and displayed in the terminal.
* Invalid inputs are handled safely without crashing the program.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **Language:** Rust
* **Concepts Used:**

---

## 📌 Key Learnings

* Writing interactive CLI programs in Rust
* Using helper functions for reusable logic
* Handling user input safely
* Organizing code for readability and maintenance


## 🔮 Future Improvements

* Use `enum` for shape selection
* Add input validation for negative values
* Convert to argument-based CLI (`std::env::args`)
* Add GUI version using `egui`
* Split logic into multiple modules
